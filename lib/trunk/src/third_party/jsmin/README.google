Description:
JSMin is a filter which removes comments and unnecessary whitespace
from JavaScript files. It typically reduces filesize by half,
resulting in faster downloads. It also encourages a more expressive
programming style because it eliminates the download cost of clean,
literate self-documentation.

Local Modifications:
None

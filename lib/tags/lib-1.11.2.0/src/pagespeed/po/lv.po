#  detected as being good candidates to be combined into CSS sprites
#  (that is, larger images containing a number of subimages, which can
#  then be used to display a single subimage at a time by using CSS to
#  reveal a different section of the large image in place of each of the
#  original small images).  It describes the problem to the user, and
#  tells them how to fix it by combining multiple small images into a
#  larger image.  The "$1" is a format string that will be replaced with
#  the URL of the page in which the small images appear.

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs of webpage resources
#  that Page Speed detected as having three properties: 1) they are
#  publicly cacheable (that is, they can be cached by HTTP proxies), 2)
#  they are compressible (that is, the data may be compressed during
#  transfer), and 3) the resource does not have a "Vary" HTTP header
#  whose value is set to "Accept-Encoding".  It describes the problem to

#  Accept-Encoding header to each of the listed resources.  Note that
#  "Vary: Accept-Encoding" is code and should not be translated.

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as lacking a "cache validator" -- that is, an HTTP header
#  that indicates to the browser how to check whether a particular item
#  in its cache is still valid.  It describes the problem to the user,
#  and tells them how to fix it by configuring their server to include a
#  "Last-Modified" HTTP header, or an "ETag" HTTP header, either of which
#  can serve as a cache validator.  Note that "Last-Modified" and "ETag"
#  are code and should not be translated.

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed

#. TRANSLATOR: The name of a Page Speed rule that tells users to ensure that
#. their server provides a "cache validator" for each served resource -- that
#. is, an HTTP header that indicates to the browser how to check whether a
#. particular item in its cache is still valid.  This is displayed in a list
#. of rule names that Page Speed generates.

#. TRANSLATOR: Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#. detected as lacking a "cache validator" -- that is, an HTTP header
#. that indicates to the browser how to check whether a particular item
#. in its cache is still valid.  It describes the problem to the user,
#. and tells them how to fix it by configuring their server to include a
#. "Last-Modified" HTTP header, or an "ETag" HTTP header, either of which
#. can serve as a cache validator.  Note that "Last-Modified" and "ETag"
#. are code and should not be translated.

#. TRANSLATOR: The name of a Page Speed rule that tells users to ensure that
#. certain resources on their webpage are served with a "Vary" HTTP header
#. whose value is set to "Accept-Encoding".  This is displayed in a list of

#. TRANSLATOR: Header at the top of a list of URLs of webpage resources

#. publicly cacheable (that is, they can be cached by HTTP proxies), 2)
#. they are compressible (that is, the data may be compressed during
#. transfer), and 3) the resource does not have a "Vary" HTTP header
#. whose value is set to "Accept-Encoding".  It describes the problem to
#. the user, and explains how to fix the problem by adding a Vary:

#. Latin-1, or some other text encoding) being used, early on in the page.
#. This is displayed in a list of rule names that Page Speed generates.

#. TRANSLATOR: Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed

#. Latin-1, or some other text encoding) being used, or declaring a
#. character set but doing so late in the page for a character set other
#. than what the browser was previously assuming.  It describes the
#. problem to the user, and tells them how to fix it by explicitly
#. specifying the character set near the beginning of the page.

#. dimensions of the image to aid the user in specifying those

#. TRANSLATOR: The name of a Page Speed rule that tells users to try to
#. replace a group of small images on their site with a "CSS sprite" -- that
#. is, a single larger image containing a number of subimages, which can then
#. be used to display a single subimage at a time by using CSS to reveal a

#. TRANSLATOR: Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed

#. (that is, larger images containing a number of subimages, which can
